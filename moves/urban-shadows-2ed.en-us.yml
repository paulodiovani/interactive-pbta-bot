    description: Tries to Goad an Opponent Into Making a Mistake (difference in Strength)
    category: faction
    results:
      complete_success: The target takes the bait; the instigating faction strikes a terrible blow, destroys a vulnerable asset, or undermines a key relationship or alliance.
      partial_success: The target avoids the worst of the trap, but causes enough trouble to embarrass themselves; they take a -1 ongoing to Strength until they restablish their reputation.

        choose 1:
        • someone exits; they are beyond reach until they choose to return
        • someone enters; the faction gains a powerful asset
        The passage offends a Status-3 NPC who seeks tribute for the trespass; the faction must perform a favor — dedicating a faction move next faction turn — sacrifice an asset, or risk open war.
      failure: The passage sparks a conflict between the faction and their own allies before it can be completed; someone comes to one of the PCs seeking help to negotiate a truce.

      partial_success: One of the mortals closest to you offers you a way to deepen your bond; clear a corruption advance if you agree to what they propose. Agreeing isn’t so simple; what they ask of you threatens to expose them to the part of your life you’ve kept hidden.
