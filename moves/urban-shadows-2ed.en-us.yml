    category: faction

    category: faction
    results:
      complete_success: The target takes the bait; the instigating faction strikes a terrible blow, destroys a vulnerable asset, or undermines a key relationship or alliance.
      success_with_complications: The target avoids the worst of the trap, but causes enough trouble to embarrass themselves; they take a -1 ongoing to Strength until they restablish their reputation.

  - name: seize-by-force
    description: Faction Seizes Something Vulnerable by Force (Strength)
    category: faction

        • they don’t suffer an immediate, retaliatory attack
        • they don’t cause serious collateral damage

    category: faction
    results:
      complete_success: |
        They uncover some crucial details, enough to ask a PC or notable NPC to pursue it further.
        They also pick 1:
        • they attract the attention of a rival faction
        • they have to make an asset vulnerable
        • they take -1 ongoing until the end of the next faction turn

      success_with_complications: |
        The way is made clear, no matter who opposes it;
        choose 1:
        • someone exits; they are beyond reach until they choose to return
        • someone enters; the faction gains a powerful asset
        The passage offends a Status-3 NPC who seeks tribute for the trespass; the faction must perform a favor — dedicating a faction move next faction turn — sacrifice an asset, or risk open war.
      failure: The passage sparks a conflict between the faction and their own allies before it can be completed; someone comes to one of the PCs seeking help to negotiate a truce.
